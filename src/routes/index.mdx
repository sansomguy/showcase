### Favourite Tools

    Capturing ideas, project planning, and all-round second brain of preference ðŸ˜‰

    SSG & SSR & Resumable application state.
    
    Gives me the ability to build backend first and serve interactive web applications  with 0 hydration cost, 10/10 lighthouse scores for SEO optimisation and super fast DX experience.
    
- **Figma**
    
    Makes UI design so much easier through simple UX that even a programmer can use ðŸ¤ª.
    
- **Miro**
    
    Digital whiteboard FAST.
    

- **Docker**
    
    Build composable self contained units of software that can be poked and prodded just like a VM.
    
    They are AMAZING as dev containers too. Think, Python without the env management frustrations.
    
- **Turbo Repo**
    
    Honestly, itâ€™s just the caching I like in this tool. ðŸ¤”Â And you sorta need the orchestration to get the benefits of the caching. Turbo.json file is annoying though.
