---

Welcome to my little piece of web **mastery**. ðŸ˜œ

## Goals
* Personal blog & branding
* Super simple to browse
* Blazingly fast
* SEO optimized
* 100 lighthouse score
* Easy to turn notion pages into blog posts


## Architecture

* [Qwik](https://qwik.dev) and [Qwik City](https://qwik.city) for components, routing, and SSR/SSG.  
* [Supabase](https://supabase.io) for data storage and authentication.
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for hosting and serverless functions.
* [Simple CSS](https://simplecss.org/) to reset my html styles and give me some variables to control my design.

## Target Audience

| Description | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Other developers interested in the same technology as me | View / comment |
| Clients looking for AI / ML skill sets  | View profile and get in touch |

## Todo

### Bugs

### UX & SEO
- [x]  Leverage Vercel CDN for cache & improved performance
- [ ]  Main menu should have sub menu open when clicked instead of navigating to a page with more links
- [ ]  Understand why there is sometimes a performance issue on first SPA navigation and fix it
- [ ]  Get in touch emails should be forwarded to me through Supabase
- [ ]  Build update subscriptions page
- [ ]  Once subscribed when I release a project update, all subscribed recipients should receive a notification
- [ ]  Ability to to receive notifications via WhatsApp and Messenger
- [ ]  Build **dynamic** sitemap.xml based on content of site for better SEO performance (Qwik City does not appear to support this out of the box ðŸ¥º).

### Content ideas
- [ ] Key acheivements page where I can continually add new acheivements weekly for reference.
- [ ] TIL page where I can add new things I've learned daily.
