**[Qwik](https://qwik.dev) Development | Development Tools**
- No decision required between SPA / MPA.
    - Every page is both. You can also opt into NOT using MPA by simply changing the link type
    - On top of that, because there is no hydration when a CDN cache is in use for your routes, THEN your site is essentially functioning as an SSG site WITH the added benefit of updating automatically based on cache controls.
- Progressively load javascript WHERE / WHEN itâ€™s used, no need to slow down page load or worry about managing bundling. If I have a page that uses an insane amount of JavaScript it should still have EPIC SEO scores.
- Easy Server vs Frontend code control
- TypeSafe REST APIs built right in with routeActions and server functions.
- Easy deploy to Vercel with edge network support for easy and low cost hosting in literally 5 minutes or less.
