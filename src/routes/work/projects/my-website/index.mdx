* Easy to turn notion pages into blog posts


## Architecture

* [Qwik](https://qwik.dev) and [Qwik City](https://qwik.city) for components, routing, and SSR/SSG.  
* [Supabase](https://supabase.io) for data storage and authentication.
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for hosting and serverless functions.
* [Simple CSS](https://simplecss.org/) to reset my html styles and give me some variables to control my design.
